                            <p>
                                It’s got that irresistible crispy, yet delicate,
                                golden brown crust. And the inside of the bánh
                                xèo is filled with delicious flavors: pork and
                                shrimp, and sprinklings of mung bean, onions and
                                bean sprouts. This crowd pleaser is a
                                hot-off-the-pan, hands-on food meant to be
                                wrapped in veggies and dipped in
                                <span class="hight">a flavorful sauce</span>.
                                Vietnamese bánh xèo, often called Vietnamese
                                pancakes, or Vietnamese crêpes, are great for
                                family style dinners and you can prep the batter
                                a night ahead of time. Lets get to sizzling!
                            </p>
                            <br />
                            <p>
                                Bánh xèo seems to be designed to be eaten as a
                                family. The batter, filling ingredients, and
                                veggies aren’t complicated to prepare, but they
                                don’t make sense to be bought or made to be
                                eaten by yourself. You don’t just buy 1/4 pound
                                of pork, 8 shrimps, or buy 1/4 head of lettuce.
                                You kind of have to bump the volume to make each
                                step worth the prep and to me, meals that are
                                shared are a lot more fun anyway. These crêpes
                                take a little bit of prep time and organization,
                                then you can just keep knocking these guys out
                                faster than people can eat them.

                                Traditional bánh xèo was probably made with only
                                rice flour and no wheat flour. If you want to go
                                full on traditional, you can replace all of the
                                wheat flour in the recipe with rice flour only
                                and it will work
